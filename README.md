# Treble
Treble keyboard is a 42 key, low profile choc v1, monoblock, moderate column staggered, wireless/wired mechanical keyboard powered by pro micro compatible MCU board. It is designed with [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen), the ergonomic keyboard generator.

The sandwich PCB design concept came from [Horizon keyboard](https://github.com/skarrmann/horizon). Bottom plate cutouts for through-hole pins makes it so that keyboard can be put on any surface, and the cover plate hides all the other internal components. Overall, this design makes the keyboard clean, low profile and look more finished without needing a dedicated case.

## Features
- Rectangular design for improved stability; easier to put on your lap and type
- Low profile: total height is about 15mm tall
- Compact: overall size smaller than Apple Magic Keyboard
- Column staggered: mildly staggered so it's easy transition from row staggered keyboard yet it provides more comfortable typing experience
- 6 thumb keys: enough thumb keys for switching to different layers
- PCBs-for-case design
- Wireless/Wired depending on your preference

- Male JST connector is only needed if the battery doesn't come with it
- You don't need Power switch, JST connector, and Battery if you build a wired keyboard

## Printable Treble
Download [Treble-A4.pdf](/docs/treble-A4.pdf) and print it. Test the keyboard layout with your own hands.

## PCB order guide
1. Download gerber files from *Releases* on sidebar
2. Submit gerber files to PCB manufacturer
3. Select manufacturing options
4. Order

### JLCPCB manufacturing options
Most options are default. Changed options in *italic*:
- Base Material: FR-4
- Layers: 2
- Dimensions: (automatically filled in)
- PCB Qty: 5
- Product Type: Industrial/Consumer electronics
- Different Design: 1
- Delivery Format: Single PCB
- PCB Thickness: 1.6
- PCB Color: *Black*
- Silkscreen: White
- Surface Finish: *LeadFree HASL*
- Outer Copper Weight: 1 oz
- Via Covering: Tented
- Min via hole size/diameter: 0.3mm/(0.4/0.45mm)
- Board Outline Tolerance: Â±0.2mm(Regular)
- Confirm Production file: No
- Mark on PCB: *Remove Mark*
- Electrical Test: Flying Probe Fully Test
- Gold Fingers: No
- Castellated Holes: No
- Edge Plating: No

I recommend **LeadFree HASL** option because you will be handling the keyboard directly without a case. Pick the PCB color of your choice. **Remove Mark** so you won't see random number printed on the PCB.

## Firmware
### ZMK
1. Setup GitHub Repo by following [ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup#github-repo)
2. Setup User Config by following [ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup#user-config-setup-script)	
3. Copy & Paste `/boards`, `/config`, and `build.yaml` from [zmk-config folder](/firmware/zmk-config) in this repo to zmk-config folder in your repo
4. Customise `treble.keymap` and `treble.conf` files in `/config` however you like it. Then push changes to your repo
```
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push -u origin main
```
5. Install firmware by following [ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup#installing-the-firmware)

- If you use MCU board other than nice!nano v2, then you will have to edit `build.yaml` file.
- [Precompiled firmware](/firmware/treble-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2.zip) is also available.
- Check out my personal [zmk-config](https://github.com/kkckrnz/zmk-config-treble) to see how I configured my keymap.
- There's [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_urj-rF3bQ) by Joe Scotto if you would rather setup from scratch.

### Other Firmware
Since the keyboard is pro micro compatible it should be able to run QMK & KMK as well (not tested).

## Build guide
Follow [Build Guide](docs/treble_build_guide.md) to assemble the keyboard.

## Feedback
For any issues or questions please let me know.

If you have built and enjoyed the keyboard, consider supporting me so I can work on future developments.
